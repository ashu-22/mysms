PHP Client Library

 Introduction

The PHP client-side library defines the PHP classes that can be (de)serialized to/from JSON. This is useful for accessing the REST endpoints that are published by this application, but only those that produce a JSON representation of their resources (content type "application/json").
This library requires the json_encode function which was included in PHP versions 5.2.0+.
